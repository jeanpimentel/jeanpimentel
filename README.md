### Hey, I'm Jean 👋🏼

I'm a polyglot software engineer with a strong technical background developed along 20+ years of experience.

- 🛠  I'm currently working at __CI&T__ as a __Staff Engineer/Senior Software Engineer__.
- 👨🏻‍💻  In the last 10 years I've also worked with _Terraform_, _k8s_ and _Google Cloud Platform_ as a devops engineer and also with _Android (Java/Kotlin)_ and _iOS (ObjC/Swift)_ as a mobile engineer.
- 📚  Fun fact: I really enjoy sci-fi books although I haven't read many in the past year.
